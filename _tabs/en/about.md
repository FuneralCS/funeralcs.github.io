## Our Mission

At FuneralCS, our goal is to bridge the knowledge gap in Turkish regarding computer science and technology. We present topics that are often only available in foreign sources in a **Turkish, understandable, and accessible** manner.
We strive to write about what is not already written and go beyond the copycat content that dominates the agenda.

## Our Vision

To contribute to making Turkish a powerful language of knowledge in the field of computer science.
Our goal is to be a **lasting and reliable source of information** for students, enthusiasts, and experts alike, covering a wide range of topics from artificial intelligence to information theory, hardware to mathematics.

## Our Values

* **Openness:** Making knowledge shareable and accessible to everyone.
* **Originality:** Bringing previously unwritten topics to the forefront.
* **Comprehensibility:** Explaining complex issues in simple language.
* **Collectivity:** Understanding that knowledge only multiplies when shared.
